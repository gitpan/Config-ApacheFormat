Revision history for Config::ApacheFormat

1.0  Sun Nov 24 12:58:35 2002
    - First version.

1.1  Tue Nov 26 12:00:00 2002
    - Added new options 'valid_directives' and 'valid_blocks' to allow
      the parser to produce syntax errors on invalid data.  Thanks to
      Rudy Lippan for the suggestion.

    - Added filenames to error messages and added code to track
      filenames and line numbers correctly across included files.

    - Fixed bug where blocks with multi-part names couldn't be
      accessed with block().

    - Fixed spelling error in API.  The wrong spelling of
      "inheritance" as "inheritence" is now deprecated.

    - Modified get() to avoid recursion when inheritance_support is
      on for a small speedup.

    - Optimized parsing for a 50% speedup on large files.

    - Lowered memory usage.

1.2  Mon Oct 20 10:52:53 PDT 2003

    - Nathan Wiger ported many features from Apache::ConfigFile in an
      effort to combine the two modules.  These features include:

        o The fix_booleans option, which allows automatic conversion
          of yes/on/true to 1 and no/off/false to 0

        o The expand_vars option, allowing reuse of previously-defined
          directives as $directive

        o The setenv_vars option, which will automatically place
          variables defined via the SetEnv directive into the %ENV
          hash

        o The hash_directives option, which allows proper handling of
          directives where the first value is really a key
          (ex. AddHandler).

        o The duplicate_directives option, which allows the programmer
          to choose how duplicate directives are handled (by default
          the last one is kept, allowing subsequent configs to
          override earlier Includes)

        o Support for multiple blocks with the same name.

        o Support for include directories and multiple include files
          on a single line

        o The root_directive option, which allows the user to define a
          root for that config file which is prepended to relative
          Include paths.

    - Added include_directives option to allow for differently named
      Include directives.

    - Removed deprecated support for the wrong spelling of
      inheritance_support as inheritence_support.

    - Fixed bug preventing mixed-case valid_directives and
      valid_blocks from working.
