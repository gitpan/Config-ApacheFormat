    - First version.

1.1  Tue Nov 26 12:00:00 2002
    - Added new options 'valid_directives' and 'valid_blocks' to allow
      the parser to produce syntax errors on invalid data.  Thanks to
      Rudy Lippan for the suggestion.

    - Added filenames to error messages and added code to track
      filenames and line numbers correctly across included files.

    - Fixed bug where blocks with multi-part names couldn't be
      accessed with block().

    - Fixed spelling error in API.  The wrong spelling of
      "inheritance" as "inheritence" is now deprecated.

    - Modified get() to avoid recursion when inheritance_support is
      on for a small speedup.

    - Optimized parsing for a 50% speedup on large files.

    - Lowered memory usage.
