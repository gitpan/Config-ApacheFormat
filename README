Config::ApacheFormat 1.2
========================

CHANGES

    - Nathan Wiger ported many features from Apache::ConfigFile in an
      effort to combine the two modules.  These features include:

        o The fix_booleans option, which allows automatic conversion
          of yes/on/true to 1 and no/off/false to 0

        o The expand_vars option, allowing reuse of previously-defined
          directives as $directive

        o The setenv_vars option, which will automatically place
          variables defined via the SetEnv directive into the %ENV
          hash

        o The hash_directives option, which allows proper handling of
          directives where the first value is really a key
          (ex. AddHandler).

        o The duplicate_directives option, which allows the programmer
          to choose how duplicate directives are handled (by default
          the last one is kept, allowing subsequent configs to
          override earlier Includes)

        o Support for multiple blocks with the same name.

        o Support for include directories and multiple include files
          on a single line

        o The root_directive option, which allows the user to define a
          root for that config file which is prepended to relative
          Include paths.

    - Added include_directives option to allow for differently named
      Include directives.

    - Removed deprecated support for the wrong spelling of
      inheritance_support as inheritence_support.

    - Fixed bug preventing mixed-case valid_directives and
      valid_blocks from working.

DESCRIPTION

    This module is designed to parse a configuration file in the same syntax
    used by the Apache web server (see http://httpd.apache.org for details).
    This allows you to build applications which can be easily managed by
    experienced Apache admins. Also, by using this module, you'll benefit
    from the support for nested blocks with built-in parameter inheritance.
    This can greatly reduce the amount or repeated information in your
    configuration files.

    A good reference to the Apache configuration file format can be found
    here:

       http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/configuring.html

    To quote from that document, concerning directive syntax:

       Apache configuration files contain one directive per line. The
       back-slash "\" may be used as the last character on a line to
       indicate that the directive continues onto the next line. There must
       be no other characters or white space between the back-slash and the
       end of the line.

       Directives in the configuration files are case-insensitive, but
       arguments to directives are often case sensitive. Lines that begin
       with the hash character "#" are considered comments, and are
       ignored. Comments may not be included on a line after a configuration
       directive. Blank lines and white space occurring before a directive
       are ignored, so you may indent directives for clarity.

    And block notation:

       Directives placed in the main configuration files apply to the entire
       server. If you wish to change the configuration for only a part of the
       server, you can scope your directives by placing them in <Directory>,
       <DirectoryMatch>, <Files>, <FilesMatch>, <Location>, and
       <LocationMatch> sections. These sections limit the application of the
       directives which they enclose to particular filesystem locations or
       URLs. They can also be nested, allowing for very fine grained
       configuration.

    This module will parse actual Apache configuration files, but you will
    need to set some options to non-default values. See the section on
    "Parsing a Real Apache Config File" in the module documentation
    for more details.
